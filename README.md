# vbaud â€” Virtually limit the bit/baud rate of your terminal

[This file](vbaud.c) provides a slow-down as you would have had on a real
terminal connected over a serial link. This is useful for
displaying VT100 animated movies as they were meant to be
watched. You can think of it as a rate-limited version of `cat`.

```sh
% make vbaud    (or: cc -o vbaud vbaud.c)
% gzip -dc animation.vt.gz | ./vbaud 9600
```
(There probably is no need to turn on compiler optimizations)

Enjoy!
